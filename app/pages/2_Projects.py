        This project was developed as part of a graduate course I took in uni.      
        It originated from a [RecSys challenge](https://research.atspotify.com/publications/recsys-challenge-2018-automatic-music-playlist-continuation/) and the solutions were based on best solution from the original challenge.
        
        The idea here was to create a program that acts in a similar way as the Spotify's Playlist Continuation feature.        
        Based on the tracks chosen by an user, the program should choose 5 possible tracks to be added to that same playlist.
        """

playlist_description = """
            #### Solution
            Based on the problem set, I chose, as baseline, an approach that used collaborative filtering for the task.     
            However, due to the lack of performance from the approach above, I decided to try a Denoising Autoencoder approach.
        
            ###### Collaborative filtering
        
            Collaborative filtering is based on learning about one's likes and dislikes based on objects with similar habits.     
            For example, recommending a movie to you because someone that, usually, likes the same movies you do gave it 5 stars.
            
            In the context of playlist continuation a person would be a playlist, the movie would be the tracks and the score would be either 1 (if the track is in the playlist) and 0 (if the track is absent from the playlist).
            
            ###### Denoising autoencoder (DAE)
            
            DAEs work by trying to remove noise from an input.      
            In this context, the noise would be removing random tracks from playlists and showing the complete playlist as expected output.

            #### Solution
            
            For this project, I trained classifiers and compared their perfomances.     
            I used the outuput probabilities of models as credit score.     
            Due to this approach, all the models were comapred using a 0.5 proba threshold for class definition.

            The data used in this project consists of multiple tables containing different information about the clients and transactions.      
            In order to develop the solution, some feature engineering was necessary.

        The main idea of this project was to automatically identify and group signals using machine learning. Signals should be grouped into 'Operational Mode' groups.     
        After the grouping phase, experts would label some of the samples in each group so that the label could be propagated to all the other samples in the group.

        #### Solution
        
        Based on the scope of the project, a clustering approach was used.

        #### Data
        
        The data used in this project were the responses from vibration sensors installed in industrial environments.
        
        #### Results
        
        The final product of the project was a <a href='https://dash.plotly.com/'>Dash</a> app in which experts can analyse and label the data.        
        This clustering method allowed the team to correct 20% of past reports, indirectly allowing the supervised model to perform better.
